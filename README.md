This project has context files and instructions for different tasks to help make a coding assistant more effective at writing [Unison](https://unison-lang.org) code.

Recommended usage:

* Add the [Unison Language Guide](./unison-language-guide.md) as context to your coding assistant.
* The [instructions](./instructions.md) prompt a model on how to use the [Unison MCP server](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/blob/trunk/docs/mcp.md) and provide coding assistance.

Note: the MCP server is under active development and not yet in an official release.

Your mileage may vary and if you have suggestions for how to better prompt the system, contributions are most welcome! More targeted guides for different topics are also welcome.
